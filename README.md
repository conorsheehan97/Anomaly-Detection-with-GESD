# Anomaly-Detection-with-GESD
Project aiming to detect Statistical Anomalies within in-process data produced during the Additive Manufacture of Ti-6Al-4V using the GESD algorithm!

3D printing is becoming increasingly popular for producing medical components, as it lets you tailor the bone implant to the patients physiology. As this technology becomes more popular, improving the process by detecting defects will become vital.
